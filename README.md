To publish to Versa 2, Versa, and Versa Lite some settings were changed to work with SDK 4.3

The older 4.3 SDK uses .gui instead of .view and .defs. Fitbit 2019 4.3 SDK link: [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20191102093406/https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/user-interface/svg-components/buttons/#button-with-icon).
