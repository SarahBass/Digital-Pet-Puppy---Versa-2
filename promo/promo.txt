*Mako, a Shiba, has all the sass, gas, and attitude of the true Shiba Inu breed (also known popularly as a 'Doge'). *

*Mr. Crunchy, a blue merle, has two blue eyes and looks like a cute mix between a Pomeranian, Husky, and Australian Shepherd. *

*Butterball, a rescue dog from Los Angeles, likes to sleep with his legs 'sploot' and looks like a fluffy mix between a Sheltie and a Papillon.*
